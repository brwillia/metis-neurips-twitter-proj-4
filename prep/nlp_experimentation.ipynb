       "ht as he could quirrell screamed and tried to throw harry off — the pain in harry’s head was building — he couldn’t see — he could only hear quirrell’s terrible shrieks and voldemort’s yells of “kill him kill him ” and other voices maybe in harry’s own head crying “harry harry ” he felt quirrell’s arm wrenched from his grasp knew all was lost and fell into blackness down down down something gold was glinting just above him the snitch he tried to catch it but his arms were too heavy he blinked it wasn’t the snitch at all it was a pair of glasses how strange he blinked again the smiling face of albus dumbledore swam into view above him “good afternoon harry ” said dumbledore  harry stared at him then he remembered “sir the stone it was quirrell he’s got the stone sir quick — “calm yourself dear boy you are a little behind the times ” said dumbledore “quirrell does not have the stone ” “then who does sir i — ” “harry please relax or madam pomfrey will have me thrown out ” harry swallowed and looked around him he realized he must be in the hospital wing he was lying in a bed with white linen sheets and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop “tokens from your friends and admirers ” said dumbledore beaming “what happened down in the dungeons between you and professor quirrell is a complete secret so naturally the whole school knows i believe your friends misters fred and george weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat no doubt they thought it would amuse you madam pomfrey however felt it might not be very hygienic and confiscated it ” “how long have i been in here ” “three days mr ronald weasley and miss granger will be most relieved you have come round they have been extremely worried ” “but sir the stone — ” “i see you are not to be distracted very well the stone professor quirrell did not manage to take it  from you i arrived in time to prevent that although you were doing very well on your own i must say ” “you got there you got hermione’s owl ” “we must have crossed in midair no sooner had i reached london than it became clear to me that the place i should be was the one i had just left i arrived just in time to pull quirrell off you — ” “it was you ” “i feared i might be too late ” “you nearly were i couldn’t have kept him off the stone much longer — ” “not the stone boy you — the effort involved nearly killed you for one terrible moment there i was afraid it had as for the stone it has been destroyed ” “destroyed ” said harry blankly “but your friend — nicolas flamel — ” “oh you know about nicolas ” said dumbledore sounding quite delighted “you did do the thing properly didn’t you well nicolas and i have had a little chat and agreed it’s all for the best ” “but that means he and his wife will die won’t they ” “they have enough elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then yes they will die ” dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on harry’s face “to one as young as you i’m sure it seems incredible but to nicolas and perenelle it really is like going to  bed after a very very long day after all to the well organized mind death is but the next great adventure you know the stone was really not such a wonderful thing as much money and life as you could want the two things most human beings would choose above all — the trouble is humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them ” harry lay there lost for words dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling “sir ” said harry “i’ve been thinking sir — even if the stone’s gone vol i mean you know who — ” “call him voldemort harry always use the proper name for things fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself ” “yes sir well voldemort’s going to try other ways of coming back isn’t he i mean he hasn’t gone has he ” “no harry he has not he is still out there somewhere perhaps looking for another body to share not being truly alive he cannot be killed he left quirrell to die he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies nevertheless harry while you may only have delayed his return to power it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time — and if he is delayed again and again why he may never return to power ” harry nodded but stopped quickly because it made his head hurt then he said “sir there are some other things i’d like to know if you can tell me things i want to know the truth about ”  “the truth ” dumbledore sighed “it is a beautiful and terrible thing and should therefore be treated with great caution however i shall answer your questions unless i have a very good reason not to in which case i beg you forgive me i shall not of course lie ” “well voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me but why would he want to kill me in the first place ” dumbledore sighed very deeply this time “alas the first thing you ask me i cannot tell you not today not now you will know one day put it from your mind for now harry when you are older i know you hate to hear this when you are ready you will know ” and harry knew it would be no good to argue “but why couldn’t quirrell touch me ” “your mother died to save you if there is one thing voldemort cannot understand it is love he didn’t realize that love as powerful as your mother’s for you leaves its own mark not a scar no visible sign to have been loved so deeply even though the person who loved us is gone will give us some protection forever it is in your very skin quirrell full of hatred greed and ambition sharing his soul with voldemort could not touch you for this reason it was agony to touch a person marked by something so good ” dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill which gave harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet when he had found his voice again harry said “and the invisibility cloak — do you know who sent it to me ”  “ah — your father happened to leave it in my possession and i thought you might like it ” dumbledore’s eyes twinkled “useful things your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here ” “and there’s something else ” “fire away ” “quirrell said snape — ” “professor snape harry ” “yes him — quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father is that true ” “well they did rather detest each other not unlike yourself and mr malfoy and then your father did something snape could never forgive ” “what ” “he saved his life ” “what ” “yes ” said dumbledore dreamily “funny the way people’s minds work isn’t it professor snape couldn’t bear being in your father’s debt i do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even then he could go back to hating your father’s memory in peace ” harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound so he stopped “and sir there’s one more thing ”  “just the one ” “how did i get the stone out of the mirror ” “ah now i’m glad you asked me that it was one of my more brilliant ideas and between you and me that’s saying something you see only one who wanted to find the stone — find it but not use it — would be able to get it otherwise they’d just see themselves making gold or drinking elixir of life my brain surprises even me sometimes now enough questions i suggest you make a start on these sweets ah bertie bott’s every flavor beans i was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomit flavored one and since then i’m afraid i’ve rather lost my liking for them — but i think i’ll be safe with a nice toffee don’t you ” he smiled and popped the golden brown bean into his mouth then he choked and said “alas ear wax ” madam pomfrey the nurse was a nice woman but very strict “just five minutes ” harry pleaded “absolutely not ” “you let professor dumbledore in ” “well of course that was the headmaster quite different you need rest ” “i am resting look lying down and everything oh go on madam pomfrey ” “oh very well ” she said “but five minutes only ” and she let ron and hermione in  “harryl” hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again but harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore “oh harry we were sure you were going to — dumbledore was so worried — ” “the whole school’s talking about it ” said ron “what really happened ” it was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors harry told them everything quirrell the mirror the stone and voldemort ron and hermione were a very good audience they gasped in all the right places and when harry told them what was under quirrell’s turban hermione screamed out loud “so the stone’s gone ” said ron finally “flamel’s just going to die ” “that’s what i said but dumbledore thinks that — what was it — ‘to the well organized mind death is but the next great adventure ’ ” “i always said he was off his rocker ” said ron looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was “so what happened to you two ” said harry “well i got back all right ” said hermione “i brought ron round — that took a while — and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall — he already knew — he just said ‘harry’s gone after him hasn’t he ’ and hurtled off to the third floor ”  “d’you think he meant you to do it ” said ron “sending you your fathers cloak and everything ” “well ” hermione exploded “if he did — i mean to say — that’s terrible — you could have been killed ” “no it isn’t ” said harry thoughtfully “he’s a funny man dumbledore i think he sort of wanted to give me a chance i think he knows more or less everything that goes on here you know i reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try and instead of stopping us he just taught us enough to help i don’t think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked it’s almost like he thought i had the right to face voldemort if i could ” “yeah dumbledore’s off his rocker all right ” said ron proudly “listen you’ve got to be up for the end of year feast tomorrow the points are all in and slytherin won of course — you missed the last quidditch match we were steamrollered by ravenclaw without you — but the food’ll be good ” at that moment madam pomfrey bustled over “you’ve had nearly fifteen minutes now out ” she said firmly •k k k after a good night’s sleep harry felt nearly back to normal “i want to go to the feast ” he told madam pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes “i can can’t i ”  “professor dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go ” she said sniffily as though in her opinion professor dumbledore didn’t realize how risky feasts could be “and you have another visitor ” “oh good ” said harry “who is it ” hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke as usual when he was indoors hagrid looked too big to be allowed he sat down next to harry took one look at him and burst into tears “it’s — all — my — ruddy — fault ” he sobbed his face in his hands “i told the evil git how ter get past fluffy i told him it was the only thing he didn’t know an’ i told him yeh could’ve died all fer a dragon egg i’ll never drink again i should be chucked out an’ made ter live as a muggle ” “hagrid ” said harry shocked to see hagrid shaking with grief and remorse great tears leaking down into his beard “hagrid he’d have found out somehow this is voldemort we’re talking about he’d have found out even if you hadn’t told him ” “yeh could’ve died ” sobbed hagrid “an’ don’ say the name ” “voldemort ” harry bellowed and hagrid was so shocked he stopped crying “i’ve met him and i’m calling him by his name please cheer up hagrid we saved the stone it’s gone he can’t use it have a chocolate frog i’ve got loads ” hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said “that reminds me i’ve got yeh a present ” “it’s not a stoat sandwich is it ” said harry anxiously and at last hagrid gave a weak chuckle  “nah dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it ’course he shoulda sacked me instead — anyway got y eh this ” it seemed to be a handsome leather covered book harry opened it curiously it was full of wizard photographs smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and father “sent owls off ter all yer parents’ old school friends askin’ fer photos knew yeh didn’ have any d’yeh like it ” harry couldn’t speak but hagrid understood harry made his way down to the end of year feast alone that night he had been held up by madam pomfrey’s fussing about insisting on giving him one last checkup so the great hall was already full it was decked out in the slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate slytherin ’s winning the house cup for the seventh year in a row a huge banner showing the slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the high table when harry walked in there was a sudden hush and then everybody started talking loudly at once he slipped into a seat between ron and hermione at the gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at him fortunately dumbledore arrived moments later the babble died away “another year gone ” dumbledore said cheerfully “and i must trouble you with an old man’s wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast what a year it has been hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were you have the  whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year starts “now as i understand it the house cup here needs awarding and the points stand thus in fourth place gryffindor with three hundred and twelve points in third hufflepuff with three hundred and fifty two ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty six and slytherin four hundred and seventy two ” a storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the slytherin table harry could see draco malfoy banging his goblet on the table it was a sickening sight “yes yes well done slytherin ” said dumbledore “however recent events must be taken into account ” the room went very still the slytherins’ smiles faded a little “ahem ” said dumbledore “i have a few last minute points to dish out let me see yes “first — to mr ronald weasley ” ron went purple in the face he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn for the best played game of chess hogwarts has seen in many years i award gryffindor house fifty points ” gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling the stars overhead seemed to quiver percy could be heard telling the other prefects “my brother you know my youngest brother got past mcgonagall’s giant chess set ” at last there was silence again  “second — to miss hermione granger for the use of cool logic in the face of fire i award gryffindor house fifty points ” hermione buried her face in her arms harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves — they were a hundred points up “third — to mr harry potter ” said dumbledore the room went deadly quiet for pure nerve and outstanding courage i award gryffindor house sixty points ” the din was deafening those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy two points — exactly the same as slytherin they had tied for the house cup — if only dumbledore had given harry just one more point dumbledore raised his hand the room gradually fell silent “there are all kinds of courage ” said dumbledore smiling “it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies but just as much to stand up to our friends i therefore award ten points to mr neville longbottom ” someone standing outside the great hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place so loud was the noise that erupted from the gryffindor table harry ron and hermione stood up to yell and cheer as neville white with shock disappeared under a pile of people hugging him he had never won so much as a point for gryffindor before harry still cheering nudged ron in the ribs and pointed at malfoy who couldn’t have looked more  stunned and horrified if he’d just had the body bind curse put on him “which means ” dumbledore called over the storm of applause for even ravenclaw and hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of slytherin “we need a little change of decoration ” he clapped his hands in an instant the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold the huge slytherin serpent vanished and a towering gryffindor lion took its place snape was shaking professor mcgonagall’s hand with a horrible forced smile he caught harry’s eye and harry knew at once that snape ’s feelings toward him hadn’t changed one jot this didn’t worry harry it seemed as though life would be back to normal next year or as normal as it ever was at hogwarts it was the best evening of harry’s life better than winning at quidditch or christmas or knocking out mountain trolls he would never ever forget tonight harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come but come they did to their great surprise both he and ron passed with good marks hermione of course had the best grades of the first years even neville scraped through his good herbology mark making up for his abysmal potions one they had hoped that goyle who was almost as stupid as he was mean might be thrown out but he had passed too it was a shame but as ron said you couldn’t have everything in life and suddenly their wardrobes were empty their trunks were packed neville’s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets notes were handed out to all students warning them not to use magic over the holidays “i always hope they’ll forget to give us  these ” said fred weasley sadly hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake they were boarding the hogwarts express talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier eating bertie bott’s every flavor beans as they sped past muggle towns pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats pulling into platform nine and three quarters at king’s cross station it took quite a while for them all to get off the platform a wizened old guard was up by the ticket barrier letting them go through the gate in twos and threes so they didn’t attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the muggles “you must come and stay this summer ” said ron “both of you — i’ll send you an owl ” “thanks ” said harry “i’ll need something to look forward to ” people jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the muggle world some of them called “bye harry ” “see you potter ” “still famous ” said ron grinning at him “not where i’m going i promise you ” said harry he ron and hermione passed through the gateway together “there he is mom there he is look ”  it was ginny weasley ron’s younger sister but she wasn’t pointing at ron “harry potter ” she squealed “look mom i can see “be quiet ginny and it’s rude to point ” mrs weasley smiled down at them “busy year ” she said “very ” said harry “thanks for the fudge and the sweater mrs weasley ” “oh it was nothing dear ” “ready are you ” it was uncle vernon still purple faced still mustached still looking furious at the nerve of harry carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people behind him stood aunt petunia and dudley looking terrified at the very sight of harry “you must be harry’s family ” said mrs weasley “in a manner of speaking ” said uncle vernon “hurry up boy we haven’t got all day ” he walked away harry hung back for a last word with ron and hermione “see you over the summer then ” “hope you have — er — a good holiday ” said hermione looking uncertainly after uncle vernon shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant  “oh i will ” said harry and they were surprised at the grin that was spreading over his face “ they don’t know we’re not allowed to use magic at home i’m going to have a lot of fun with dudley this summer ” '"
